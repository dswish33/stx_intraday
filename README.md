# stx_intraday
Quick analysis of intraday momentum effects on last 30 minutes of NY trading session via best subset regression. Analysis inspired by paper: "Hedging demand and market intraday momentum" written by Dr. Guido Baltussen, Dr. Zhi Da, Dr. Sten Lammers, and Martin Martens.


Note:
Other projects have much more promise. Lack of attainable alpha as well as the barrier of entry to hft/mft for stocks makes me put any other analysis on this topic on the backburner.
